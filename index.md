## New Yorkers are feeling the need for New Blood, with NY Attorney General Office and the Judiciary of NY highly CORRUPT under CUOMO’S LEADERSHIP

Cuomo’s legacy has left us corrupt JUDGES and a dysfunctional New York Attorney General’s office that fails to protect the rights and assets of New Yorkers. 
In 2017, a Brooklyn Housing Court judge, Daniele Chinea, left a resident without water for 5 months. The same judge held an innocent mother and two daughters for 18 months in her court for something that should have been dismissed after she reviewed the evidence, but that was not the case.
“NYCHA fought 18-month court battle to evict innocent family until Daily News inquired about the case”
In 2018, after numerous scandals, Judge Daniele Chinea was transferred to the New York Housing Court, which is one of many promotions this Judge received for such lack of common-sense. In New York, Judge Chinea has continued her path of wrongdoings in several cases, from accepting false evidence and refusing to dismiss cases that were absurd, to even VIOLATING HOUSING COURT RULES AND ALTERING PROCEDURES OF THE COURT to favor landlord’s attorney , we are reviewing five cases 2018–2020 from this Judge which proves procedural violations, the acceptance of false evidence while exposing her incapacity for the job she has been granted. Of course, under the sponsorship of GOV. Cuomo, Daniele Chinea seems untouchable , and even stands as the president of the Association of Housing Court Judges. 
While the New York Attorney General opened an investigation into Andrew Cuomo a year after he began placing COVID 19 patients in nursing homes, the NYAG was aware of these actions for a full year and did nothing to save victims' lives. Was this a political movement of Letita James's office? Did she sacrificed tens of thousands of lives to get Cuomo out? .....

## Doordash Spying on Restaurants and Drivers


The Company’s survival “Doordash” depends on a financial model designed by early investors and developers to give the illusion of success to users, with the hope that the accumulation and growth of restaurants and drivers, one day, will be sufficient to make Doordash profitable, not the current case. 
The company exists today and is backed by investors’ money, after going public in 2020, Doordash’s stock was highly overvalued, generating a large amount of cash that allows the company‘s operation and gave early investors the opportunity to take their money plus large profits and run. But Doordash is struggling to maintain the illusion of growth, and the documentary filmed from May 2020 to early 2021 will expose those facts by tracking down a dasher “delivery driver” and a restaurants, while also exposing the company’s practices and truths.
During the filming of the documentary “Doordash, Trading Human Futures” From the same producer of NETFLIX'S CODE BIAS , SHALINI KANTAYYA will release her production this summer, "We quickly realized that Doordash's services were not what we were told or expected. The company claimed to make payments to restaurants every Wednesday for the previous week's sales, which turned out to be false, the company made payments sporadically and weeks went by without receiving payments"  Said Kantayya
The documentary exposes bogus payment schedule is the least of the problems Doordash creates for restaurants. The company gives a tablet to every restaurant that agrees to pay $ 6 a week, also restaurants have a merchant account that is can be accessed from any computer. But tablets and the merchant account are for viewing orders only, as restaurant owners have no control over their stores. Doordash closes restaurants without permission from restaurant owners when it doesn't have enough drivers and doesn't let restaurants know. Furthermore even if a restaurant owner clicks the open option at the app or the merchant account the store will not open. 
Shortly after we finished filming the restaurant that was working with us and captured the truth of Doordash's services, it was decided to cancel Doordash and remove the restaurant from the platform. And that's when we were forced to start filming again, as Doordash refused to terminate the service and began harassing and spying on the restaurant...................
